/* =========================================================
   Question bank — 10 questions, 5 competencies × 2 each.
   Every option is written to sound defensible; scoring
   (1–10 per question, max total = 100) separates real sales
   instincts from plausible-sounding answers. Scores are
   never shown to the candidate.

   The strongest option for each question reflects:
     Q1  rejection      — persistence, quick reset, learning from the no
     Q2  tough deal     — clear thinking, ownership, mid-course adjustment
     Q3  rapport        — listening before pitching, earned credibility
     Q4  lead priority  — qualification and strategy over raw activity
     Q5  client needs   — questioning skill, digging past surface answers
     Q6  hitting target — owned, repeatable process; consistency not luck
     Q7  objections     — composure, addressing the real concern directly
     Q8  learning       — self-driven improvement, openness to feedback
     Q9  team selling   — collaboration without losing ownership
     Q10 motivation     — internal drive and discipline through slumps
